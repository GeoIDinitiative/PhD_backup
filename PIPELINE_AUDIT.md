# Tilt Denoising / Bandpass / SWCC — Pipeline Audit & Rebuild Record

_Audit date: 2026-05-29. Scope: observed-signal denoising, 0.001–0.01 Hz bandpass, and sliding-window
cross-correlation (SWCC) against simulation tilt templates, for the INGV (winter 2022–23) and
experiment (summer 2023) periods._

## 1. Data lineage

| Stage | Artifact | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Raw | `/home/owen/Signals/...` feathers + `EC1.csv` | 1 Hz nominal; INGV has east/north/mag, experiment has x/y(/mag) |
| P-wave excision | `tilt_raw_pwave_removed/<ST>_*.feather` | UTC datetimes; earthquake windows removed via `pwave_buffer.calculate_pwave_buffers` |
| **(rebuild input)** | ↑ these feathers | gaps = recording breaks **and** excised quake windows |
| Old bandpass | `bandpassed_exports_001_01_csv_only_utc/` | produced by `plot_fix/signals.py`; **kept for regression, not reused** |
| Templates | `tilt_templates_csv/<dataset>/` | 96 per dataset = 6 stations × 4 sims × 4 templates, single `x` component, ~3334 s long |

## 2. Findings

**A1 — Bandpass design (KEEP).** Butterworth order 4, `sos`, zero-phase `sosfiltfilt`, band
0.001–0.01 Hz, fs 1 Hz. Zero-phase is correct for preserving cross-correlation timing. Band verified
appropriate: periods 100–1000 s, above tidal/thermal noise, below the teleseismic body-wave band.

**A2 — Atmospheric/environmental cleaning ABSENT.** No barometric/thermal/tidal correction; the
declared `fc_highpass = 1e-5` is never applied. No barometer data exists on disk, so a pressure-
admittance correction is impossible. Physics mitigates this — environmental tilt noise is largely
at periods ≫1000 s, below the 0.001 Hz corner, so the bandpass removes most of it. Remaining
defects: **no detrend before filtering** (DC/drift → edge transients) and **no despiking**.
→ Rebuild adds per-segment detrend + Hampel/MAD despike. (Decision: spectral+detrend only.)

**A3 — Non-uniform time base filtered as uniform (DEFECT).** `seconds` is 1 Hz for >99.99 % of
samples but contains multi-million-second jumps at the recording breaks (~22 Nov, ~12 Dec).
`sosfiltfilt` across a gap rings for thousands of seconds. → Rebuild filters **per continuous
segment**.

**A4 — SWCC performance (BLOCKER).** Correct Pearson-r math, but a pure-Python loop:
≈2.8×10¹⁰ ops/template, run twice × 96 templates. → Rebuild vectorizes via cumsum running-moments +
FFT convolution (validated against the loop).

**A5 — Splice / through-quake artifacts (FLAW).** Old "cleaned" path concatenates non-contiguous
samples and correlates across splices (spurious peaks, mislabeled times); old "full" path filters
through earthquakes (ringing smears into clean windows). → Rebuild correlates **within segments
only**, on already-excised raw.

**A6 — Component mismatch.** Observed bandpass used `mag` (rectified ≥0); templates are bipolar
`x`. → Rebuild runs **both** a directional component (INGV `east`, experiment `x`) and magnitude,
and compares.

**A7 — UTC.** Old exports embed original time base + −1 h read-time anchor. Rebuild carries true UTC
datetimes end-to-end (input feathers already UTC); anchor bookkeeping retired.

**A8 — SNR & peaks (KEEP, document).** SNR guard 3000 s / half-window 10000 s; `find_peaks(|r|,
height=0.2, distance=1000)`. `|r|` counts anti-correlations as detections (polarity ambiguity) —
intended, now stated.

## 3. Rebuilt pipeline (this folder only; originals untouched)

1. `build_clean_bandpassed.py` — segment at gaps → despike (MAD) → linear detrend → per-segment
   zero-phase Butterworth bandpass 0.001–0.01 Hz → reassemble on UTC axis (gaps preserved).
   Output `clean_bandpassed/<dataset>/<ST>_<component>_0p001-0p01Hz_clean_bp.feather` + meta.
2. `swcc_comprehensive.py` — vectorized, segment-aware normalized SWCC for both components ×
   sims × templates → `SWCC_comprehensive/` peak CSVs, plots, mag-vs-directional comparison.
3. Credibility gates — numerical-equivalence vs old loop; filter magnitude/step response; old-vs-new
   before/after; phase-randomized null test for the r=0.2 false-peak floor.

## 4. Component map

| Station | Dataset | Directional | Magnitude |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| ECPN, EEC1 | ingv | `east` | `mag` |
| EC10, ECIT, ECOR, EMAS | experiment | `x` | `mag` |
| EC1 | experiment | `x` | √(x²+y²) (computed) |

## 5. Results & the credibility finding (run 2026-05-29)

Stage 1 (`build_clean_bandpassed.py`, ~9 s) and Stage 3 (`swcc_comprehensive.py`, ~6 s; old loop
would have taken hours) both ran clean. Numerical-equivalence gate vs the old loop: **max|Δr| =
3e-16** (machine precision) — the vectorised SWCC is exact.

**Headline credibility result — the r=0.2 threshold is not significant.** The phase-randomised
null test (`credibility/null_test.*`) shows that a surrogate with the *same power spectrum but
random phase* routinely reaches **max|r| ≈ 0.5**, with a **99th-percentile floor of ≈ 0.61
(ingv) / 0.65 (experiment)**, and yields ~61 supra-0.2 "peaks" per surrogate. Cause: in the narrow
0.001–0.01 Hz band a ~3334-s template has only ~30 independent DOF, so chance Pearson r is large.

**Edge-handling correction (important).** The first significance pass reported 167 survivors with
14 synchronous EMAS↔ECOR events at |r| up to 0.91. Investigating the per-segment filter startup
spike showed these were **edge transients**: a fresh 0.001–0.01 Hz filter (settling ≈1716 s) starts
at every gap boundary and rings up into a smooth low-frequency swing that correlates strongly with
the (smooth) templates. Because segments begin at *shared* earthquake-excision boundaries, those
transients align across stations and faked "synchrony" (all earlier sync events fell within 20 min
of a segment start). Edge handling was tested across methods; **even-reflection padding**
(`sosfiltfilt padtype="even", padlen=settling`) reduces both-end edge inflation to ≈1.0× without
distorting waveform shape (odd padding blew the *end* up ~7.5×; Tukey tapering distorts shape).

Final significance with corrected edges (`all_peaks_flagged.csv`, `significance_summary.txt`):

| metric | default-pad (initial) | **even-pad (correct)** |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| total peaks | 15 500 | 14 976 |
| survivors of 99th-pct null floor | 167 (1.1 %) | **37 (0.25 %)** |
| cross-station synchronous events | 14 (EMAS↔ECOR, \|r\|→0.91) | **2 (weak, \|r\|≈0.52–0.55)** |
| max \|r\| | 0.93 | **0.66** |

**Implication for the thesis (revised, honest):** once edge transients are removed, there is
**little credible evidence** of strong template-matched tilt transients. Survivors are sparse and
sit *just* above the null floor (ECPN winter |r|≈0.63–0.66 vs floor 0.626; experiment |r|≈0.52–0.59
vs floor 0.515), and cross-station coincidence essentially vanishes (2 weak events). The earlier
"EMAS/ECOR synchronous detections" were a processing artefact, not signal. This is the corrected
result; the null floor + clean edges together are what make it trustworthy. Magnitude vs
directional remain comparable.

## 6. template4 (long template) — separate procedure

template4 is **10,001 samples (~2.8 h)**, 3× longer than templates 1–3 (~3,333). It cannot be
hosted by the short post-excision segments (median ~83 min), so it is removed from the main SWCC
(`TEMPLATES = T1–3`) and run by `swcc_template4.py` with matched parameters: window = its own
length, peak spacing 3,000, and a **T4-specific null floor**. Results are merged into
`all_peaks_flagged.csv` tagged `procedure="T4_long"` vs `"main_T1-3"`.

Coverage is intrinsically tiny: **0 experiment segments** are ≥10,001 samples (T4 not evaluable
there) and only **2 per INGV station**. The T4 null floor is **0.336** — far below the T1–3 floor
(0.626), because a longer template has more degrees of freedom and thus a lower chance-correlation
baseline (judging T4 against the T1–3 floor would have been wrong). Even so, the 12 T4 peaks
(max |r| 0.32) all fall **below** their own floor → **0 significant**. Conclusion: T4 adds no
credible detections on the current (heavily fragmented) data; making it useful would require
longer segments, i.e. gentler P-wave excision. (Corrects an earlier mistaken note that template4
was "flat/degenerate" — it is simply too long for the segments.)
